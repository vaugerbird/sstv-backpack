## Hardware Revisions
I currently have 2 hardware revisions available, with a 3rd planned: 
1. v1.0:
    * Mostly through-hole and completely hand-solderable
    * Simplest version with only a voltage regulator circuit, PTT circuit, 2 switches, a buzzer, and the ESP32-CAM
    * Requires external board for flashing and a serial monitor
2. v1.1: 
    * Still mostly through-hole and hand-solderable, albeit with some fine-pitch components like the FTDI chip
    * Retains all the same functionality of v1.0, but adds an FTDI USB-to-Serial chip for flashing and a serial monitor.
    * The board is quite cramped and may be hard to work with
3. v1.2 (WIP):
    * Switch to an mostly top-mounted SMD design, while still being hand-solderable
    * Retain all features of the v1.1 board
    * Pogo pins for power will be mounted on the board 

## Assembly Instructions
1. Upload your desired [Gerber](./hardware/gerbers/) file to your favorite PCB manufacturer. I recommend OSHPark for US-made, decent priced small-batch PCBs. JLCPCB or PCBWay are both great for cheap, high quality PCBs, if you don't mind waiting.

2. Order the required parts using the proper BOM for [v1.0](./hardware/v1.0/sstv-backpack-v1.0.1.csv) or [v1.1](./hardware/v1.1/sstv-backpack-v1.1.csv) from your favorite parts supplier.

3. Once all parts arrive, assemble the board. There isn't much of a technique to it, just start with the lowest profile parts first like the diodes, resistors, and chips, and work your way up.

4. Once the board is complete, print the case using one of the included [STLs](./hardware/case). Currently, the Baofeng UV-5R is the only supported radio, but the Inventor 2025 and STEP files are included, and help with additional radio models is always appreciated!

    * I used the standard settings (0.2mm) on my print, with supports on, and the case interior facing the build plate.

    * The case requires these additional parts:
        * 4 - M3 brass het set inserts
        * 4 - M3 x 6mm screws (preferably hex head)
        * 4 - M2 x 4mm screws
        * 1 - Radio cable (I just cut the end off of a cheap Baofeng speaker-mic, it was cheaper than using an unterminated cable.)

5. After you have the hardware assembled, the next thing to do is upload the code!

## Programming Instructions
1. Ensure that you have this link added to the 3rd party boards section of the Arduino IDE (Found under File -> Preferences -> Additional board manager URLs):
```
https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json
```

2. From the board manager, install the newest version of the ESP32 board definitions.

3. Set the board model to "AI Thinker ESP32-CAM" and select the appropriate COM port.

4. Change the text options on lines 37 and 38 of [sstv-backpack.ino](./code/sstv-backpack.ino) to reflect your callsign and desired splash text.
    * The color of the top and bottom text can be changed with the definitions in lines 24-31. 

5. Uncomment line 21 ```#define USE_FLASH``` if you want to use the flash LED (Turns on a high intensity white LED on when framegrabbing).

6. At line 447, set `1 = HIGH` or `0 = LOW` properly reflect your CAPT_BTN wiring (GND or +3.3V)

7. Between line 452-456, choose the correct button pull-up/pull-down configuration. The button is set to pull-up by default to mirror the PCBs. (Button connects to GND when pressed)

8. Inside "camera.h" file you can choose between two profiles, DAYLIGHT and HOME. Feel free to modify settings to best suit your case. 
	* Notes from IU5HKU:
		* Keep in mind that this cheap sensor struggles a lot in poor light scenarios, so don't expect a picture like your Fujifilm camera.
		* A quick search online can lead you towards the proper settings values you need.

9. All the board settings can be left alone except for selecting the correct COM port.

10. Upload the code!

## Contributors
 A huge thank you to contributors to this project! I'm pretty bad with code so all help is greatly appreciated!

 * [IU5HKU / Marco](https://github.com/IU5HKU) - Updated the code to work with the newest version of the ESP32 board definition and improved the readability/useability of the code!
 * [IU5HKU / Marco](https://github.com/IU5HKU) - Updated the code to work with deepsleep/wakeup ESP32 functions (maximize battery life).
